# 스스로 모델 만들기

- [github:DEvol - Deep Neural Network Evolution](https://github.com/joeddav/devol)

DeepLearning Project Workflow라고 읽고
Bias-Variance Tradeoff에 가까운데 가끔 비슷한 질문이 올라오는 것 같아서 올립니다.

모델 성능이 원하는대로 나오지 않을때

1) 데이터를 더 모아야 하는지
2) 더 큰 모델을 만들어야 할 지

High bias, High Variance 체크를 통해 간단히 판단하는 법입니다.

Some important parameters to look out for while optimizing neural networks are:
- Type of architecture
- Number of Layers
- Number of Neurons in a layer
- Regularization parameters
- Learning Rate
- Type of optimization / backpropagation technique to use
- Dropout rate
- Weight sharing
- etc.
- etc for CNN : convolutional filter size, pooling value, etc.
Here are some resources for tips and tricks for training neural networks.
