SqueezeNet: 

SqueezeNet is a network architecture which is remarkable not for its accuracy but for how less computation it needs. SqueezeNet has accuracy levels close to that of AlexNet however, the pre-trained model on ImageNet has a size less than 5 MB which is great for using CNNs in a real world application. SqueezeNet introduced a Fire module which is made of alternate Squeeze and Expand modules.
